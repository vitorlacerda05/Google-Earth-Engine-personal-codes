# Google Earth Engine Scripts Collection üåç

This repository contains a set of scripts developed for the **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** platform between 2021 and 2022. These scripts are focused on remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and geospatial data analysis using satellite imagery, primarily from **Sentinel** and **Landsat** missions.

## üåê What is Google Earth Engine?

[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) is a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform that enables users to process and analyze petabytes of satellite imagery and other geospatial datasets. It is widely used in academia, government, NGOs, and industry for applications such as environmental monitoring, land cover classification, agricultural assessment, climate research, and more.

With a JavaScript-based code editor and access to massive public datasets, GEE allows users to create, visualize, and share powerful geospatial analyses at scale.
